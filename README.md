Taken from https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/tree/master/challenge/2024, The goal of the challenge is to celebrate the data visualization legacy of W.E.B Du Bois by recreating the visualizations from the 1900 Paris Exposition using modern tools such as  (Tableau, R, ggplot, Stata, PowerBI, decksh, etc).

There is a folder for each challenge, which includes the images of the 1900 original plates along with the corresponding data. 

For 2024, the challenge will occur on X (formally Twitter), LinkedIn, Data Visualization Society Slack, Instagram, as well as Mastadon on vis.social.

## How It Began
The idea for the #DuBoisChallenge came from Allen Hillery and Sekou Tyler. In early February, 2021, Allen and Sekou approached me with the idea of creating an online challenge where people would recreate selected Du Bois visualizations and share their work online. Allen was aware of my prior work recreating over 50 Du Bois visualizations, and since I had the data already compiled, I was thrilled and delighted to help.
