# 2024DuBoisChallenge
![duboisChallenge2024](https://github.com/sndaba/2024DuBoisChallengeInRstats/assets/53818579/4b18b046-b06f-4bb6-b071-3b27dab2293f)

Taken from https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/tree/master/challenge/2024, The goal of the challenge is to celebrate the data visualization legacy of W.E.B Du Bois by recreating the visualizations from the 1900 Paris Exposition using modern tools such as  (Tableau, R, ggplot, Stata, PowerBI, decksh, etc).

There is a folder for each challenge, which includes the images of the 1900 original plates along with the corresponding data. 

For 2024, the challenge will occur on X (formally Twitter), LinkedIn, Data Visualization Society Slack, Instagram, as well as Mastadon on vis.social.

## Who was W.E.B Du Bois

W.E.B. Du Bois is predominantly known as a scholar, activist, and author, but he was also a data visualization innovator. Born in 1868, Du Bois was the first Black American to receive a doctorate from Harvard, then studied and traveled in Europe before returning to the United States to focus on a career in the social sciences. Desperate to advance the rights and quality of life for Black people, Du Bois set out to collect the compelling evidence needed for cultural change. But he quickly realized more than reporting statistical data was needed to change a lifetime of racial oppression.

In 1900, Du Bois had the opportunity to design and curate [“The Exhibit of American Negroes”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exhibit_of_American_Negroes) for the Exposition Universelle in Paris. He writes in his autobiography: “I wanted to set down its aim and method in some outstanding way, which would bring my work to the thinking world. The great World’s Fair at Paris was being planned and I thought I might put my findings into plans, charts and figures, so one might see what we were trying to accomplish.” Du Bois’s [visualizations for the Paris Exposition](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/first-time-together-and-color-book-displays-web-du-bois-visionary-infographics-180970826/) were innovative in two ways. First, his systematic approach to building a data-driven argument is powerful in its comprehension and scope and second, he took a unique approach with the graphical methods he used in his visualizations.

## How It Began
The idea for the #DuBoisChallenge came from Allen Hillery and Sekou Tyler. In early February, 2021, Allen and Sekou approached me with the idea of creating an online challenge where people would recreate selected Du Bois visualizations and share their work online. Allen was aware of my prior work recreating over 50 Du Bois visualizations, and since I had the data already compiled, I was thrilled and delighted to help.

## The Process
All of the visualizations (the originals and my recreations) and their underlying data were already collected in my github repo, so I made a special directory for the challenge.  The participant’s goal was to re-create the visualizations using modern tools of their choice (Tableau, R, ggplot, Stata, PowerBI, decksh, etc) and submit their re-creations to Twitter using the hashtag #DuBoisChallenge.  The challenge would run over several weeks, highlighting one visual per week.  Officially, the challenge ran for seven weeks, starting February 16, 2021,  but given the nature of online communities, people continued to submit their re-creations, re-mixes and reactions long afterwards.

## The Challenges
For the challenge every year, a curated list of Du Bois’s visualizations are chosen that would best represent his work, while giving people a range of chart types to work with – from simple bar charts, to maps, to the famous “Du Bois spirals”.  

In 2024, the theme for the challenge will be organized around the colors of the Pan African flag: Challenges 1-3: red, Challenges 4-6: black, Challenges 7-9: green, Challenge 10: a combination.
